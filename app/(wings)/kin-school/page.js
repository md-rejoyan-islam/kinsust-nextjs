            Education is one of the basic necessities of human life, and it is
            the only weapon that holds the power of changing an entire nation.
            Unfortunately, some children are lagging behind in that race, either
            because they are not aware of its importance or they can
            {"'"}t bear the expenses the opportunity brings with it. In the year
            2004, a group of young dreamers from Shahjalal University of Science
            & Technology (SUST) took the aim of spreading the light of education
            among the leftover, underprivileged children of the society, so that
            they can also have access to that opportunity. To fulfill that noble
            aim, <span className="kin">KIN</span>{" "}
            <span className="font-semibold">School </span>
            was formed.
